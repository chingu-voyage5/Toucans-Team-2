# MemoryGame (FEND)
## Purpose:
  This repo holds the code I wrote to complete the Udacity Front-End NanoDegree Memory Game project. All code will be committed through this repo, and progress can be tracked.

_All consideration given to the Udacity style guides and project rubric_


## How to play

  Ready to test your memory skills?

  This simple, yet challenging take on a classic memory game will allow you to showcase your ability to find matches from out of thin air!


### Gameplay:

* Once the page loads, the board is set!
* The timer will start once you make your first selection and stop as soon as all matches are found <br>
  -*Try to set a new speed record!*
* You begin with three stars. The more moves it takes to find matches,
    the fewer stars you keep, so choose wisely!
* Once all matches are found the times stops and the BRAGGING can begin!
